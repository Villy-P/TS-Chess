## Languages Used

---

- **TypeScript** for the majority of the code.
- **JavaScript** (TypeScript compiles into JavaScript, so about half of the code will be JavaScript)
- **SASS/CSS** For styling the webpage
- **HTML** for making the webpage
- **Git** for source control
- **JSON** for the tsconfig file

## Intro to HTML

---

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language used for creating webpages.
All webpages on the internet has an HTML page.
HTML uses tags to create webpages.

Each page needs to start with a `DOCTYPE` tag like this:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This tells the browser to expect a HTML type when it loads in the page.

Next you can specify the language as such:

``` html
<html lang="en">
```

The `<html>` tag needs to have an ending. In fact, most tags in HTML need endings. Here is an example of the *paragraph* tag, which tells the browser to load in text:

``` html
<p>This is a paragraph tag with an ending --></p>
```

The `<html>` tags ending will be located at the end of the file. All code within these two tags will be loaded into the webpage.

Next we specify a `<head>` tag like so:

``` html
<head>
    <title>Chess</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/CSS/style.css">
</head>
```

This tag is used for storing data about the webpage. That `<title>` tag tells the browser what name to give the webpage so it can display it to the user.

We'll come back to what the `<link>` tag does later.

Right after the `<head>` tag we have our `<body>` tag, which tells the webpage what to display to the screen.

The first the in out `<body>` is `<ul>`, which specifies a new unordered list.
Within the `<ul>` tag we give it an `id` of `"header"`, so that in the CSS and TypeScript/JavaScript we can access it by that id.

Within the unordered list we have the `<li>` tag which is a list item.

Here is an example of the `<ul>` tag and the `<li>` tag.

``` html
<ul>
    <li>This</li>
    <li>Is</li>
    <li>An</li>
    <li>Unordered</li>
    <li>List</li>
</ul>
```

This returns:

- This
- Is
- An
- Unordered
- List

Within the `<li>`, there is a `<a>` tag with a `href` of `javascript:void(0)` and a class of `dropdown`. The class is sort of the same as an id, and the `href` attribute specifies what the link's destination will be.  
When we set that value to `javascript:void(0)`, it basically says *do nothing*.

Then we have this long `<div>` tag:

``` html
<div class="dropdown-content">
    <a href="#"><input type="color" value="#FFFFFF" id="colorWell1"> White Square</a>
    <a href="#"><input type="color" value="#006400" id="colorWell2"> Black Square</a>
    <a href="#"><input type="color" value="#5f9ea0" id="colorWell3"> Canvas Background</a>
    <a href="#"><input type="color" value="#25383C" id="colorWell4"> Background Color</a>
    <a href="#"><input type="color" value="#38444d" id="colorWell5"> Header Color</a>
    <a href="#"><input type="color" value="#FFFFFF" id="colorWell6"> History Canvas Background</a>
</div>
```

The `<div>` tag itself specifies a certain section of the webpage and it has a class name of `dropdown-content`.
Each item within the `<div>` tag has an `<a>` tag with a href of `"#"` (do nothing) and an `<input>` tag that specifies the type of input.
We set the `type` attribute to `color` so the webpage knows we will be making a color selector.
Then we give the base color value as a certain hexadecimal value, which is a very fancy way of specifying different color (Like an RGBA value).
The `#FFFFFF` color is white, specifyed by the 3 pairs of `FF`, which means full values of Red, Green, and White (255, 255, 255).
Next we assign each value an `id` so we can access it in the TypeScript/JavaScript.
The White Text is what we will actually be displaying to the user.

When you look at the unordered list in the webpage it does not look like a list, but rathers a bar with dropdowns.
This is due to styling in CSS, which we will go over later.

Next, we create two canvases with the `<canvas>` tag.
A canvas is a box that we can draw things on, such as shapes and images.
The `historyCanvas` will be used for displaying the game history, and the `mainCanvas` will be used for the actual chess game.

Next we have many `<script>` tags with an `src` attribute.
Whatever we put into `src`, the program will read whatever file and load that in. The `<script>` tag is for JavaScript, so we load in many Javascript pages.
We'll go over all these files later.

## SASS & CSS

---

In our HTML file, within the `<head>` tag, we have a `<link>` tag with a `rel` of `stylesheet` and a `href` of `src/CSS/style.css`.
`rel` stands for *relationship* and is used to tell what *type* of link it will be.
Then we assign it a link that points to our stylesheet.

Now, within our `src/CSS` we have three files:

- `style.css`
- `style.css.map`
- `style.scss`

The first two were autogenerated by the third one. The third one is a `Sass` file, which compiles to CSS.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is *the worst thing to ever be made by humans, and is used to style `HTML` elements.
SASS is a way of making CSS less garbage.
You set attributes to values in three ways:

``` css
/* By tag*/
body {}
/* By Id*/
#idName {}
/* By class name*/
.className {}
```

You will put the style elements within the braces.

Let's look at the first element: `body`.

Since there is no `#` or `.`, we know that we will be changing the attributes of a tag.
This means whatever changes we make will apply to all `<body>` tags.

This is our `body` part in the `style.scss` file:

``` css
body {
    background-color: #25383C;
}
```
